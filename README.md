 The application has an abstract class named Employee.
 The Employee class has fields employee ID,name,gender,salary and a pure virtual function calcSalary().
 Create three additional classes named AdminEmployee, FacultyEmployee,FinanceEmployee and  that are derived from Employee class.
Each of the subclasses will override the calcSalary() function and show relevent salary input by the user.
In main function create base class pointer and  invoke the calcSalary() method for each type of  subclasses in a polymorphic manner.  
Note: Define appropriate setter / getter for input in Employee Data Members / Fields.
